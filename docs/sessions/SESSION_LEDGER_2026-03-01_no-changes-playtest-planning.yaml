decisions_made:
  - decision: "Playtest before adding new features"
    rationale: "Cupid matchmaking (v0.10.0) and v0.9.2 fixes are entirely unplaytested. Better to shake out bugs before building more."

open_questions: []

known_risks:
  - "Cupid feature entirely unplaytested — UI, prompt quality, heartbreak timing all need validation"
  - "Crowd noise 3x volume boost (v0.9.2) not yet playtested"
  - "npm run validate still fails on Node.js 25.6.1 (pre-existing import.meta.env issue)"

explicitly_deferred:
  - "conversationFlags wiring — carry-forward from v0.9.1, recommended as next dev task after playtesting"
  - "Heartbroken match visual — fading/dimmed pink line after partner death (polish item)"
  - "Playtest pass — carried forward again; recommended as immediate next action"

next_actions:
  - "Playtest Cupid feature: button gating, two-step picker, romantic overheards, radar lines, stage transitions, heartbreak"
  - "Playtest v0.9.2 fixes: scroll direction, vertical grade inclinometer, crowd noise volume"
  - "Test player death gunshot timing with warning voice"
  - "Wire up conversationFlags to influence NPC behavior (after playtest bugs resolved)"
